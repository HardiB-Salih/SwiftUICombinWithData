# SwiftUICombinWithData

SwiftUICombinWithData is an advanced SwiftUI app that seamlessly reads data from JSON and CSV files, transforming them into Swift objects for efficient data handling. The app also incorporates Firebase integration to collect data and provide real-time notifications. Moreover, it offers a lite mode option to reduce animation heaviness, making it more suitable for older devices.

## Features

- **Data Parsing**: Read data from JSON and CSV files and convert them into Swift objects for streamlined data management.
- **Firebase Integration**: Utilize Firebase to collect data and implement real-time notifications for an enhanced user experience.
- **Lite Mode**: Optimize the app's animation and performance to provide a smoother experience on older devices.

## Getting Started

To get started with SwiftUICombinWithData, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Xcode: Ensure you have the latest version of Xcode installed on your macOS system.

### Installation

1. Clone the SwiftUICombinWithData repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/swiftui-combinwithdata.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd swiftui-combinwithdata
```

3. Open the Xcode project:

```bash
xed .
```

4. Build and run the app using the desired simulator or connected device.

### Data Sources

The app utilizes both JSON and CSV files to fetch and transform data. The JSON and CSV files are located in the app's resources and are read at runtime to populate the Swift objects.

### Firebase Integration

To enable Firebase features such as data collection and real-time notifications, you need to set up a Firebase project and integrate it into the app. Ensure that you have the necessary Firebase configuration files (e.g., `GoogleService-Info.plist`) added to the project.

## Lite Mode

The lite mode option is available within the app's settings or preferences. When enabled, it reduces the animation heaviness and enhances the app's performance, particularly on older devices.
